    <center><h1>First Django Website</h1></center>
    <center><p>Hi, this is my first website. I will be using this website to mess around and see how django works.</p></center>
<h2>Math</h2>
<p>My favorite math topic is Geometry, especially Euclidean Geometry.</p>
<p>My subject distribution is GANC, where going from left to right is how much I like to how much I dislike.</p>
<p>I participated in MATHCOUNTS Chapter competition, and missed the state cutoff by a few points. I will also take the AMC10 and AMC8 this year.<p>
<p>For math resources, I highly recommend AoPS (artofproblemsolving.com), as I personally learned math there. The community is also really awesome, and you will learn a lot. </p>
<h3>CS</h3>
<p>I only know Python, and I just started using Django for websites.</p>
<p>I think USACO is pretty cool, so I would like to do that competition in the future. (hopefully I can make it to Gold division)</p>
<h4>CyberPatriots</h4>
<p>I am a newbie on my school's CyberPatriots team. I am on the Ubuntu portion of the team, because that is my main operating system and I know how to use it more than Windows.</p>
<p>I can really say much here because, well after all, I am a newbie.</p>
